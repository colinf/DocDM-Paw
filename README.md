#### All collections for a database
    GET http://localhost:57772/api/document/v1/{Database name}
#### All documents for a collection
    GET http://localhost:57772/api/document/v1/{Database name}/{Collection name}
#### Get a document from a collection
    GET /api/document/v1/{Database name}/{Collection name}/{Document Id}
You can use the _Document-Id_ header in the request as an easy way to enter the Document Id for your request (this is part of my Paw implementation, not the DocDM API).
#### Get last inserted document from a collection
This is the same as _Get a document from a collection_ except that the Document Id is automatically populated from the last document inserted.
#### Filtered documents for a collection
    POST http://localhost:57772/api/document/v1/{Database name}/{Collection name}?action=query
Returns all Documents from a Collection in a Database that match the Query specified in the body of the request.
#### Populate a collection from Array
    POST http://localhost:57772/api/document/v1/{Database name}/{Collection name}?action=insertArray
Populate a Collection by inserting one Document for each object in the array in the request body.
#### Delete a collection from the database
    DELETE http://localhost:57772/api/document/v1/{Database name}/{Collection name}
#### Insert new document in a collection
    POST http://localhost:57772/api/document/v1/{Database name}/{Collection name}
Insert a single Document into a Collection in a Database. The document to be inserted is defined as a JSON object in the request body.
#### Update a document in a collection
    PUT http://localhost:57772/api/document/v1/{Database name}/{Collection name}/{Document Id}
Update an existing Document within a Collection in a Database. The updated document defined as a JSON object in the request body. You can use the _Document-Id_ header in the request as an easy way to enter the Document Id for your request (this is part of my Paw implementation, not the DocDM API).
#### Update last inserted document in a collection
This is the same as _Update a document in a collection_ except that the Document Id is automatically populated from the last document inserted.
#### Delete a document from a collection
    DELETE http://localhost:57772/api/document/v1/{Database name}/{Collection name}/{Document Id}
Delete an existing Document from a Collection in a Database. You can use the _Document-Id_ header in the request as an easy way to enter the Document Id for your request (this is part of my Paw implementation, not the DocDM API).
